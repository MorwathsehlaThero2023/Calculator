Calculator Project

In the "Calculator" project, I employed a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional digital calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project showcases my ability to blend design, user interaction, and mathematical logic to produce an intuitive and dynamic web application.

HTML: Structuring the Interface
HTML played a fundamental role in creating the user interface of the calculator. I used HTML to build the layout, buttons, and display area where users input numbers and see the results of their calculations. I structured the buttons for digits, operators, and special functions using appropriate HTML elements to ensure semantic and accessible markup.

CSS: Styling for User Experience
CSS was crucial for styling the calculator and enhancing its visual appeal. I applied CSS to create a visually cohesive design, choosing fonts, colors, and button styles that mimic the appearance of physical calculators. The layout was optimized for both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable user experience across devices.

JavaScript: Enabling Functionalities
JavaScript played a central role in bringing the calculator to life. I used JavaScript to implement the following functionalities:

Input Handling: Capturing user clicks on buttons and updating the display accordingly.
Arithmetic Logic: Handling mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Decimal Point Handling: Ensuring accurate decimal point placement and preventing multiple decimal points in a number.
Clear and Delete Functions: Allowing users to clear the display and delete individual digits.
Equal Button: Evaluating the expression and displaying the result upon clicking the equal button.
By utilizing JavaScript, the calculator can dynamically process user inputs and deliver accurate results in real-time.

User Interaction and Experience
The "Calculator" project doesn't just perform calculations; it provides an interactive and user-friendly experience. I implemented interactive button animations, highlighting buttons upon hover and click, creating visual feedback that enhances the overall usability of the calculator.

Conclusion
The "Calculator" project underscores my proficiency in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing web application. This project showcases my ability to develop intuitive user interfaces, implement complex mathematical logic, and seamlessly integrate design and interactivity. It serves as evidence of my capability to create dynamic and interactive web experiences that cater to user needs and streamline everyday tasks.
